### AirportAgentSimulation-MaliciousJanitor

A plugin providing a MaliciousJanitor for the AirportAgentSimulation of my university class.

The MaliciousJanitor Agent is classified as attacker.
It randomly wanders around the simulation world and has a specific chance to place down a SlowDownTile. For example, this could be seen as waxing the floor.
If an entity walks over a SlowDownTile it receives a temporary slowdown.

The compiled jar can be found in `out/artifacts`.
